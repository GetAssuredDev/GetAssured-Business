1\.Â  Encourages creativity

As times change, businesses will have to adapt and change to keep up. Creativity might seem vague and intangible but results of creativity can be seen in the products or services offered. Positive working environment enhances creativity which in turn boosts work productivity.

2\. Spurs innovation

Just like creativity, the ability to innovate or reinvent is something all enterprise values. Innovation is applicable to products made, services offered or even solutions developed to resolve daily challenges. Generating new ideas and thinking out of the box is crucial for companies to progress.
