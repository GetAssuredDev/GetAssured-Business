### About GetAssured

{:.font-up-1}
As Singapore's first life insurance based employee benefits portal, GetAssured for Business is committed to helping you take better care of your employees at no additional cost so you can focus on growing your business. We don’t believe in a one-size fits all benefits programme so we developed a transparent algorithmic process that helps your employees compare products and analyse what they really need. The best part? Commission rebate is given back to your employees, so let us start helping you build a happier, healthier and more productive team.
