    problems:
      - content: One-size-fits-all coverage is dated - We hear you! We know creating benefits strategy that appeals to all ages, gender and habits is not an easy job. Each of your employee is unique and standard coverage is just insufficient to cater to them individually.
      - content: Double coverage - Despite fantastic benefits package from MNCs, most employees would have their own personal insurance coverage. This means that some policies from group insurance may overlap with what your employees already have.
      - content: Talent retention - 85% of the HR from MNCs ranked retaining employees as their top priority. We know MNCs are under the constant pressure to be a leader in terms of offering better employee benefits.
      - solution: Fret not! With GetAssured, you will be able to offer bespoke benefits for your employees. Using the tools on our portal, your employees can simply do a 3 minutes questionnaire to find out what they need and purchase plans with up to 80% commission rebate!
      - solution: Instead of offering coverage that your employees might not need, why not translate a portion of the premium to a flexi employee benefits wallet. This allows your employees compare across products on GetAssured and opt for benefits that they really need!
      - solution: We can help! With GetAssured, you can beef up your employee benefits package by offering customised insurance solutions to individual employees. Giving your employees a say in their benefits package allows them to maximise the benefits and boosts employee satisfaction.

    problems:
      - content: Ineligible for employee benefits - We know that unlike full-time employees, gig economy staffs do not enjoy medical benefits for hospitalisation expenses. In addition, without CPF contribution, they are lacking behind their full-time counterparts in terms of savings for retirement.
      - content: Stigma of Gig Economy companies - Many people think that gig economy companies are just out to make profits at the expenses of their staffs.
      - content: Staffs take on multiple roles - As the company grows, we know HR takes on multiple roles and have limited time to manage employee benefits.
      - solution: We got your staffs covered on GetAssured! On our self-served platform, we offer personal life insurance to cover your staffs in times of hospitalisation and endowment plans to help them with their retirement plans.
