    - title: One-Size-Fits-All Coverage Is Dated
      sub: We hear you! We know creating benefits strategy that appeals to all ages, gender and habits is not an easy job. Each of your employee is unique and standard coverage is just insufficient to cater to them individually.
    - title: Double Coverage
      sub: Despite fantastic benefits package from MNCs, most employees would have their own personal insurance coverage. This means that some policies from group insurance may overlap with what your employees already have.
    - title: Talent Retention

      sub: Many people think that gig economy companies are just out to make profits at the expenses of their staffs.
    - title: Staffs Take On Multiple Roles
