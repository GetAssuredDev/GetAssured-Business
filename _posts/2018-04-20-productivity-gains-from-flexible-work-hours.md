The traditional 9-5 working day is the norm for over a century, but the current working generation realised that this is not an exceptionally productive way of doing things. Modern research is beginning to show that there's a potential downside to the rigid eight hour work day. 

Historically, many countries take breaks in the middle of the day due to heat-related factors.  This makes sense if you are working outside and the temperature hits 40°C. It might be less significant if you work in an air-conditioned office. However, according to our body clocks, there are two low points where we tend to be less alert during the 24-hour cycle. The low points usually occur in the early afternoon and during the wee hours of the morning. When we combine the therapeutic value of a nap with the low point in our body clock, having a break during the early afternoon creates a lot of sense.  But what if we can't do this?

A flexible approach to work hours may go a long way to achieving a similar balance for your workers. Giving employees control over when they start and finish is an effective method of engaging them and making them part of this process. Working together as a team in the company requires communication and respect. Arbitrarily deciding that there is only one solution to every problem and everyone in the team has to conform will take the engagement portion away from the equation. This leaves employees feeling unappreciated and resentful. 

Flexible working hours has a range of benefits.  Firstly, there will be positive psychological impact on workers as they feel that they have control over their work.  Secondly, there's the ability to utilize your workforce more efficiently by taking advantage of staggered start and finish times. Thirdly, you now have an excellent opportunity for improving business relationships with clients in other time zones.

Attitude affects productivity. Тhіs іs а gооd ехаmрlе оf how a small change could have a significant effect. By allowing your employees to handle their work time to suit their unique conditions, you have given them a powerful tool to work better for you. They are no longer concerned and distracted by timing issues and can work openly, knowing you support their choices.

Being able to use your workforce better will bring positive effects for your company financially.  Ultimately, businesses serve two functions: To service a perceived need in the market and to generate income. Flexibility will be helpful in our іnсrеаsіnglу соnnесtеd wоrld as bеіng аblе tо sеrvісе сlients from other time zones is getting more important.
