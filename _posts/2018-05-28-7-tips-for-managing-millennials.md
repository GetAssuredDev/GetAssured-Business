Millennials are the twenty-somethings that grew up with the internet. Everyone is a computer specialist and they are connected all over the world by email, instant messages, text messages, video clips and the internet. They are positive and confident, ready to take on the world and convinced that they could.

They tend to get bored easily and manage multiple tasks concurrently. They can talk to you, send texts and watch TV all at the same time. They love challenges and want flexibility as well as a life outside of work.

Тір 3 Еngаgе them

Міllеnnіаls hаvе еndlеss оріnіоns so ask whаt thеу thіnk and show respect for their ideas. It is time to finally understand that you might not have answers all the time.  Do not bore them with your war stories or dismiss their ideas even if they look way out.  Listen with an open mind and you might find amazing ideas from them.

Tip 4 Invite them with positive feedback

Millennials are positive and self-assured. Take an encouraging approach rather than faulting them for trivial matters. Previously, traditional managers spend lots оf tіmе catching errors and criticising their staffs. Instead, adopt a positive reinforcement approach and watch your staffs develop when you give them positive feedbacks sincerely and regularly.

Tip 5 Place them in teams

Millennials are not lone rangers; they link, share and network all the time.  Unlike earlier generations, millennials believe that teams can accomplish more and do it better than individuals working alone.  Place them in teams and capitalize on their skills.

It would be easier if their managers express clearly what needs to be done but allow them the flexibility, within agreed limits, on how they do it.

Limiting your communication to only provide millennials with instructions, criticism will not work well.  Millennials are determined to get ahead; they are impatient and expect the best from their jobs as well as everyone around them. They do need new leadership style but require their managers to apply simple principles more skillfully as compared to the past.
