Even though perceived as becoming more technologically savvy than skilled, millennials are described as high achievers and team players.

Millennials tend to change jobs as they are continuously looking to progress in their career. In a PricewaterhouseCoopers poll on millennials shaping the workplace, 54% said they expected to jump between two and five companies over thе соursе оf thеіr саrееr. Наvіng аn еmрlоуеr whо іnvеsts іn thеm аnd giving them the chance to develop new skills are more likely to increase the probability of them staying. When asked what makes a company appealing, more than half cited opportunities.

All these variables make leadership development for millennials essential. Unfortunately, many companies don't seem to see it. Although a majority of respondents agree that millennials need training and development to succeed, most companies do not currently offer leadership development programs specifically for them.

Here are three tips for coaching millennials to become your company's next leaders.

1) Keep Content Short and Relevant

Millennials have been taught to be resourceful. Technology has trained this generation to skip the boring and irrelevant. That said, they are far from complacent. They are hungry to learn new skills that can help their careers advance.

By keeping content concise, more time is allocated for learning job-specific material that impacts them. Short videos or task-relevant, scenario-based games which may be accessed during the time in work environments have also proven to be successful.

2) Offer Frequent Feedback

Among the strongest distinguishing feedbacks on millennials, according to the PricewaterhouseCoopers survey, is the desire for praise and regular feedback for work well done. They do not just want feedbacks on where they could improve, they want input on what they are doing.

Companies that are effective at managing millennials will be those that set clear expectations and supply regular, structured feedback that's incorporated into training and development programs. Implementing a program for millennials is one way to ensure you're providing opportunities for feedback and coaching.

Using assessments that include responses from an assortment of people in the worker's sphere of influence, including direct reports and colleagues, is one way to ensure you're providing sufficient feedback to them.

3) Make Training A Game
